## News

- I am recruiting a Ph.D student starting in Summer or Fall 2025 on the topic of spatio-temporal point processes. More information about the call [here](https://github.com/dsulem/dsulem.github.io/tree/dsulem-patch-6/docs/phd-position.pdf).

<!-- In July 2024, I started as an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) of Data Science in the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en) at the Universita della Svizzera Italiana.
- In September 2024, I will be giving a talk at the [BIRS workshop "Frontiers of Bayesian Inference and Data Science"](https://www.birs.ca/events/2024/5-day-workshops/24w5196). -->

## About me

My research interests include **networks**,  **point processes**, **Bayesian inference**, **high-dimensional and nonparametric statistics**, **explainability and fairness in Machine Learning**.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu), [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) and [Vincent Rivoirard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/). From 2023 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/) and [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/).

<!--  My [Ph.D. thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:7a4b5a4d-ff38-462b-a068-f93c8237de2f) is entitled "Flexible estimation of temporal point processes and graphs" -->

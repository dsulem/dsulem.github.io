## About me

I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) of Data Science in the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en) at the Universita della Svizzera Italiana. [Here](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/hicoda/) is my institutional homepage at the Computing Institute.

My research interests include **graphs/networks**,  **point processes**, **Bayesian inference**, **high-dimensional and nonparametric statistics**, **explainability and fairness in machine learning**.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford in 2023, under the supervision of [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu), [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) and [Vincent Rivoirard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/). I was then a postdoctoral researcher at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/) and [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) where I worked with [David Rossell](https://sites.google.com/site/rosselldavid/) and [GÃ bor Lugosi](https://www.upf.edu/web/gabor-lugosi). I joined my current position in 2024 and lead the [Statistical Science Laboratory](https://www.ci.inf.usi.ch/research/hicoda/).

<!--  My [Ph.D. thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:7a4b5a4d-ff38-462b-a068-f93c8237de2f) is entitled "Flexible estimation of temporal point processes and graphs" -->

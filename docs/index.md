**NEWS: I am looking for post-doc positions starting from January 2023.**

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

I am supervised by Pr. [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu), [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) and [Vincent Rivoirard (Universit√© Paris Dauphine)](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/).
        
Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) in Paris. 
  
My research interests lie in Bayesian nonparametric methods and graph-related problems. I have notably been working on Hawkes processes, spectral clustering, graph neural networks and variational inference. I'm also interested in explainable machine learning.

I am currently a post-doctoral research at the [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/)-[Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) in the [Statistics group](https://sites.google.com/view/stats-upf/).

My main research topics at the moment are **high-dimensional statistics**, **Bayesian inference**, and **networks**.

I am also interested in **variational inference** and **explainability and fairness in machine learning**.

Prior to this position, I obtained a PhD in the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu), [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) and [Vincent Rivoirard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/).
Before that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) in Paris.

I am currently PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford with [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu) and [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/).
        
Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). 
  
My main research interests lie in Bayesian nonparametric statistics and machine learning for graphs.
  
I'm also interested in variational inference, explainable machine learning and differential privacy.

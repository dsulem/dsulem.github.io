I was born in Paris where I first completed an Engineering Degree (Applied Mathematics track) at [Ecole Polytechnique, Paris](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). I was originally trained as a Physicist in the French Classes Préparatoires at [Lycee Louis-le-Grand](https://www.louislegrand.fr/), a 2-year undergraduate course preparing for the Engineering schools' competitive admission exams. At Ecole Polytechnique, I became interested in Data Science and Machine Learning and wrote my master thesis on Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks during a research internship at the [NYU's Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/).

I then became passionate about research at the intersection between Computer Science, Mathematics, and Machine Learning and started a doctoral program at the [University of Oxford in Statistics and Machine Learning](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/). I entered the 2018 Oxford student cohort of the [Oxford-Warwick Center for Doctoral Training in Statistical Science](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/) and started my Ph.D. in 2019, working on Bayesian nonparametrics and graphs, under the supervision of [Prof. Judith Rousseau](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Prof. Vincent Rivoirard (Université PSL-Paris Dauphine)](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/), [Prof. Mihai Cucuringu](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuring/) and [Prof. Xiaowen Dong (Department of Engineering Sciences)](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/).

I enjoy a lot doing research partly because I like to collaborate with different people around the world. In 2021, I did an internship in the Machine Learning research team at Amazon Web Services in Berlin, under the supervision of [Dr. Michele Donini](https://www.amazon.science/author/michele-donini). I was also a visiting graduate student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago in Fall 2022, where I worked with [Prof. Chao Gao](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~chaogao/) on graph synchronisation. I also visited the Machine Learning and Data Science Research Unit at [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/) led by [Prof. Makoto Yamada](https://riken-yamada.github.io/profile.html) in 2023 and 2024.

From 2023 to 2024, I joined the [Statistics group](https://sites.google.com/view/stats-upf/) at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) and [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu/) as a postdoctoral researcher and became an Assistant Professor in the [Faculty of Informatics](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en) at the Universita della Svizzera Italiana in July 2024.

I am part of the 2018 Oxford student cohort of the [Oxford-Warwick Center for Doctoral Training in Statistical Science](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/).

My supervisors are [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu), [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) and  [Vincent Rivoirard (Universit√© Paris Dauphine)](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/).
        
Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) with a specialisation in Applied Mathematics. 
  
My work focuses on the frequentist properties of Bayesian statistical methods for point processes and on the development and analysis of methods for general graphs, in particular using Graph Neural Networks.
  
I'm also interested in variational inference and explainability methods for machine learning models.

I recently did a research internship at Amazon Research in Berlin with [Michele Donini](https://www.amazon.science/author/michele-donini) on explainable anomaly detection in time series.

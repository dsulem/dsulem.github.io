I have recently joined the [Statistics group](https://sites.google.com/view/stats-upf/) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

Before that, I was part of the 2018 Oxford student cohort of the [Oxford-Warwick Center for Doctoral Training in Statistical Science](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/).

During my PhD, I also did an internship at Amazon Research Berlin with [Michele Donini](https://www.amazon.science/author/michele-donini) where I worked on on explainability methods for anomaly detection.

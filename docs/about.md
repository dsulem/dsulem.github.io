I am part of the 2018 Oxford student cohort of the [Oxford-Warwick Center for Doctoral Training in Statistical Science](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/).

I began my PhD (call DPhil in the University of Oxford) in October 2019 with Professors [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/) (Department of Statistics), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu) (Department of Statistics, Mathematical Institute, Alan Turing Institute, London), [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) (Department of Engineering Science) and  [Vincent Rivoirard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/) (CEREMADE, Universit√© Paris Dauphine).
        
Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) with a specialisation in Applied Mathematics (coursework includes Stochastic Simulation, Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Stochastic Models in Finance). 
  
My research focuses on Bayesian nonparametric methods for point processes and on graph-related topics, in particular graph neural networks.
I have also been working on variational inference and high-dimensional models.

I recently did a research internship at Amazon Research in Berlin with [Michele Donini](https://www.amazon.science/author/michele-donini) on explainable machine learning.

I am part of the 2018 Oxford student cohort of the [Oxford-Warwick Center for Doctoral Training in Statistical Science](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/).

I am currently supervised by Professors [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/) (Department of Statistics), [Mihai Cucuringu](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cucuringu) (Department of Statistics, Mathematical Institute, Alan Turing Institute, London), [Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) (Department of Engineering Science) and  [Vincent Rivoirard](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~rivoirar/) (CEREMADE, Universit√© Paris Dauphine).
        
Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) with a specialisation in Applied Mathematics. 
  
My research focuses on Bayesian nonparametric methods for point processes and on graph-related topics, in particular clustering, network change-point detection, graph neural networks, and phase synchronisation.

In summer 2021, I did a research internship at Amazon Research Berlin with [Michele Donini](https://www.amazon.science/author/michele-donini) on explainable machine learning. I was also a non-degree visiting student in the department of Statistics at the University of Chicago in Fall 2022.

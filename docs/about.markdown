I am currently PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford with [Judith Rousseau](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rousseau/).
        
<p>Prior to that, I received an Engineering Degree from <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole Polytechnique </a> 
  
<p> My main research interests lie in Bayesian nonparametric statistics and machine learning. My work focuses on the frequentist properties of Bayesian statistical methods for point processes and on the development and analysis of methods for general graphs, in particular using Graph Neural Networks.
  
<p> I'm also interested in variational inference, explainable machine learning and differential privacy.

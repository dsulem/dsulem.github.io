I practice Ashtanga Yoga, which I first learnt in the fabulous [Ashtanga Studio Berlin](https://www.ashtangastudio.de/en/) and continued learning in the [Ashtanga Yoga Shala](https://ashtangayogabcn.com/) in Barcelona. Amongst other sports I enjoy a lot mountaineering skiing, running, and Taekwondo. 

I am also passionate about music and I play the violin.


<!--  I was part of the [EquiStats Oxford](https://tylerkf.github.io/equistats/) equity and diversity discussion group and [Oxford University TaeKwon-Do School](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~outkd/). I also studied violin with [Saskia Lethiec](http://www.saskialethiec.com/) in CRR de Versailles.-->
